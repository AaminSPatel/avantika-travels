# TODO: Implement Toggle Button for Package Categories on Mobile

- [ ] Add state `isCategoriesVisible` to control category visibility, defaulting to false
- [ ] Make the chevron icon clickable to toggle the `isCategoriesVisible` state
- [ ] Wrap the category filter buttons in a `motion.div` with slide-down animation from top when showing
- [ ] Apply responsive classes: hide categories by default on mobile, always show on larger screens (md and up)
- [ ] Add rotation animation to the chevron icon based on toggle state for better UX
